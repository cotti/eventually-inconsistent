I've been wanting to do this for a while now - or attempt to.

To create a blog specifically for technicalities, one that was bilingual (to reach twice as nobody). With a simpler design.

Nowadays, it's almost impossible to find a Wordpress theme for blogs - especially one that insists on living in the sensibilities of more than 20 years ago.

Yet here we are, trying to get used to Hugo and its ways of doing things. "But Cotti," you almost say, "you can't even maintain your normal blog, are you going to maintain two?" - That's the catch.

After a certain point of me writing things, I noticed this. The more I pretend I don't care, the more ideas appear. If I have everything organized, it becomes substantially easier to write.
